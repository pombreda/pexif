#summary References used when coding

This work couldn't be done with the reference for the spec. In particular I worked to:

JFIF Specification: http://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/itu-t81.pdf
Exif Specification: http://www.exif.org/Exif2-2.PDF

For the format of the Canon stuff I used: http://www.burren.cx/david/canon.html
