This work couldn't be done with the reference for the spec. In particular I worked to:

 * JFIF Specification: http://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/itu-t81.pdf
 * Exif Specification: http://www.exif.org/Exif2-2.PDF
 * XMP Specification: http://www.aiim.org/documents/standards/xmpspecification.pdf (Not currently used)
 * Canon format: http://www.burren.cx/david/canon.html
